                    My name is Chadd Artaud and I was born and raised in San Diego, California. I am a 24 year old
                    beginning my journey into software engineering. My first experience with coding was as an 
                    undergraduate at the University of Nevada, Reno where I earned my Bachelors of Science in Mechanical 
                    Engineering. I enjoy solving challenging problems as there is no better feeling than solving 
                    a problem that you have been working on for a long period of time. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I first started learning software development, I was a self learner for 6 months. Once I had a firm grasp of 
                    the basics, I decided to take the next step and sign up for a full stack software development bootcamp through University of California, 
                    San Diego Extension program. My goal for myself is to be working as a software engineer by the end of this year
                    where I can continuously learn and improve my software engineering skills.
